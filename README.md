# SvelteKit User Registration Form

This project is a simple user registration form built using the Svelte framework. It features a clean and responsive design with interactive elements such as password visibility toggling and a terms and conditions popup.

## Overview

The SvelteKit User Registration Form provides a straightforward way for users to sign up on a website. It includes input validation for the username, email, and password fields. The password field also has an eye toggle feature, allowing users to easily switch between hidden and visible password text. Additionally, there's an interactive terms and conditions popup for users to review the terms before agreeing. This project marks my first experience with SvelteKit, a powerful framework for building web applications. The development process was smooth and enjoyable, thanks to the simplicity and effectiveness of SvelteKit's architecture. The component-based structure and the ability to write clean and concise code were particularly impressive.
